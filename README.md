Hi there! I'm **[Hadley](http://hadleyrose.io)**, a full-time caffeinator, wanna-be writer, and lover of code and cartoons alike.

When I'm not digging deep into spreadsheets or jamming on [my (Notion) planner](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadleyrose/webby/2f85451ce6a3720173ddf87d8aa0a610ef8a0a7b/public/assets/images/JamminPlanner.png), you can find me at the nearest bookstore or cinema or cozied up with my [furballs](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hadleyrose/webby/2f85451ce6a3720173ddf87d8aa0a610ef8a0a7b/public/assets/images/CagneyBanner.png) and family in front of the TV.

Get to know me on socials or reach out [via email](mailto:hadleyrosemitchell@gmail.com?subject=Hello%20Hadley%21).
